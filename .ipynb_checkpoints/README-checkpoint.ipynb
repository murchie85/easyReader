    "- Text simplification via **rules engine**\n",
    "    - Find existing tools and encorporate or build from scratch  \n",
    "- Image Support \n",
    "    - Have images inserted at complex words, sentences to simplify the description \n",
    "- **DIY Doc simplification Builder**\n",
    "    - A potential interimn solution would be to build a harness app that would allow you to paste in the text, and it would give you tools to add in your simplification parts, upload images etc.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Dynamic Support\n",
    "    - Interactive tools for users to play with, helping to understand hard concepts\n",
    "- Output Format\n",
    "    - Initially potentially just a document scanner which outputs HTML interactive page, or other Doc Form. Uploads for hosting so a website can be used to view it. \n",
    "    - Later consider full hosting options for sessions and users   \n",
    "- Feedback systems\n",
    "    - Highlight any text sentence the user is highlighting. \n",
    "    - Allow user to click a big button on text samples that says \"I don understand\"\n"
